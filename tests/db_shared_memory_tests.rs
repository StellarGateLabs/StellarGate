//! Proves the shared-cache in-memory SQLite fixture used across this suite
//! (issue #309) is genuinely shared across pooled connections — not merely
//! passing by connection-reuse luck the way a bare `sqlite::memory:` DSN did.
//!
//! `sqlite::memory:` gives every connection its own **private** database:
//! two connections opened against that DSN never see each other's writes,
//! even in the same process. A pool configured with more than one connection
//! (which is the default — and what `tests/concurrency_tests.rs` needs to
//! exercise real concurrent writers) could silently hand out a second,
//! unrelated database mid-test. `sqlite:file:<name>?mode=memory&cache=shared`
//! fixes this: every connection that opens the same named in-memory database
//! shares it, as long as at least one connection stays open (hence
//! `min_connections(1)` everywhere this DSN is used — SQLite drops a
//! shared-cache in-memory database once every connection to it closes).
