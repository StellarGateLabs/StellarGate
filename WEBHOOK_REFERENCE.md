# Webhook Reference Guide

This is the **canonical webhook documentation** for StellarGate. For webhook delivery management endpoints (list/redeliver), see [Webhook Delivery Management](#webhook-delivery-management). For integration examples, see [Integration Examples](#integration-examples).

## Overview

When a payment reaches a terminal state, StellarGate POSTs a signed JSON event to your webhook endpoint. Every request carries cryptographic headers that let you verify both authenticity and freshness — preventing replay attacks and tampering.

```
Payment created (pending)
    ↓
On-chain transaction detected
    ↓
Amount reconciled (completed/overpaid/underpaid)
    ↓
Webhook dispatched with signed payload
```

## Event Types

StellarGate fires exactly one event when a payment settles, determined by comparing received amount to requested amount:

### `payment.completed`

Fired when cumulative payment equals the requested amount exactly.

```json
{
  "event": "payment.completed",
  "payment_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "merchant_id": "your-merchant-id",
  "tx_hash": "abc123def456...",
  "amount": "10.00",
  "paid_amount": "10.00",
  "asset": "XLM",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

### `payment.overpaid`

Fired when cumulative payment **exceeds** the requested amount. The `delta` field shows the excess amount to consider refunding.

```json
{
  "event": "payment.overpaid",
  "payment_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "merchant_id": "your-merchant-id",
  "tx_hash": "abc123def456...",
  "amount": "10.00",
  "paid_amount": "12.50",
  "asset": "XLM",
  "status": "completed",
  "delta": "2.50"
}
```

### `payment.underpaid`

Fired when a payment arrives but falls **short** of the requested amount. The `delta` field shows the remaining shortfall. The intent remains open for a top-up payment.

```json
{
  "event": "payment.underpaid",
  "payment_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "merchant_id": "your-merchant-id",
  "tx_hash": "abc123def456...",
  "amount": "10.00",
  "paid_amount": "7.00",
  "asset": "XLM",
  "status": "underpaid",
  "delta": "3.00"
}
```

### `payment.expired`

Fired when a payment intent's TTL elapses before payment arrives. No further transactions are watched for this intent.

```json
{
  "event": "payment.expired",
  "payment_id": "a1b2c3d4-...",
  "merchant_id": "your-merchant-id",
  "tx_hash": null,
  "amount": "10.00",
  "paid_amount": null,
  "asset": "XLM",
  "status": "expired"
}
```

## Webhook Headers

Every webhook request includes three headers:

| Header | Description | Signed? |
|---|---|---|
| `X-StellarGate-Timestamp` | Unix time (seconds) when event was signed | ✅ Yes |
| `X-StellarGate-Signature` | Hex HMAC-SHA256 of `"{timestamp}.{raw_body}"` | ✅ Yes |
| `X-StellarGate-Event` | Copy of the `event` field from body (routing convenience) | ❌ No |

**Important:** `X-StellarGate-Event` is not covered by the HMAC signature. It mirrors the body's `event` field but can be altered in transit. Always read the event type from the signed JSON body after verifying the signature.

## Verifying Webhooks

Use this recipe to verify each incoming webhook:

1. **Extract headers:**
   - Read `X-StellarGate-Timestamp` as `t` (Unix seconds)
   - Read `X-StellarGate-Signature` as `sig` (hex string)

2. **Check timestamp freshness:**
   - Reject if `abs(now - t) > tolerance`
   - Recommended tolerance: **5 minutes** (300 seconds)
   - This bounds the replay window: a stolen request becomes useless after 5 minutes

3. **Recompute signature:**
   - Get the **exact raw bytes** received (before JSON re-encoding)
   - Compute `HMAC_SHA256(WEBHOOK_SECRET, "{t}.{raw_body}")`
   - Hex-encode the result
   - Example: if body is `{"event":"payment.completed"...}` and `t` is `1719072645`, compute HMAC over the string `"1719072645.{\"event\":\"payment.completed\"...}"`

4. **Constant-time comparison:**
   - Compare computed signature to `sig` using a **timing-safe** equality check
   - Reject on mismatch

5. **Parse and route:**
   - After signature verification passes, parse the JSON
   - Read the `event` field from the body to determine the event type
   - Route based on `event` (not on the `X-StellarGate-Event` header)

### Verification Examples

**Node.js:**

```javascript
const crypto = require("crypto");

function verify(rawBody, headers, secret, toleranceSec = 300) {
  const t = Number(headers["x-stellargate-timestamp"]);
  const sig = headers["x-stellargate-signature"];
  
  // 1. Check timestamp freshness
  if (!Number.isFinite(t) || Math.abs(Date.now() / 1000 - t) > toleranceSec) {
    return false; // stale or missing timestamp
  }
  
  // 2. Recompute signature
  const expected = crypto
    .createHmac("sha256", secret)
    .update(`${t}.${rawBody}`)
    .digest("hex");
  
  // 3. Constant-time comparison
  return crypto.timingSafeEqual(Buffer.from(sig), Buffer.from(expected));
}

// Usage: always read the event type from the verified body
function handleWebhook(rawBody, headers, secret) {
  if (!verify(rawBody, headers, secret)) {
    throw new Error("invalid signature");
  }
  
  const payload = JSON.parse(rawBody);
  const event = payload.event; // authenticated; safe to route on
  
  switch (event) {
    case "payment.completed":
      console.log("Payment completed:", payload.payment_id);
      break;
    case "payment.overpaid":
      console.log("Overpaid by:", payload.delta);
      break;
    case "payment.underpaid":
      console.log("Underpaid by:", payload.delta);
      break;
    case "payment.expired":
      console.log("Payment expired");
      break;
  }
}
```

**Python:**

```python
import hmac
import hashlib
import json
import time

def verify(raw_body, headers, secret, tolerance_sec=300):
    """Verify webhook signature and timestamp."""
    try:
        t = int(headers.get("x-stellargate-timestamp", 0))
        sig = headers.get("x-stellargate-signature", "")
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        return False
    
    # 1. Check timestamp freshness
    if not t or abs(time.time() - t) > tolerance_sec:
        return False
    
    # 2. Recompute signature (ensure raw_body is bytes, not string)
    if isinstance(raw_body, str):
        raw_body = raw_body.encode("utf-8")
    
    payload = f"{t}.".encode("utf-8") + raw_body
    computed = hmac.new(
        secret.encode("utf-8"),
        payload,
        hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    
    # 3. Constant-time comparison
    return hmac.compare_digest(computed, sig)

def handle_webhook(raw_body, headers, secret):
    """Handle incoming webhook with verification."""
    if not verify(raw_body, headers, secret):
        raise ValueError("invalid signature")
    
    payload = json.loads(raw_body)
    event = payload["event"]  # authenticated; safe to route on
    
    if event == "payment.completed":
        print(f"Payment completed: {payload['payment_id']}")
    elif event == "payment.overpaid":
        print(f"Overpaid by: {payload['delta']}")
    elif event == "payment.underpaid":
        print(f"Underpaid by: {payload['delta']}")
    elif event == "payment.expired":
        print("Payment expired")
```

## Webhook Delivery Management

StellarGate tracks all webhook delivery attempts in the `webhook_deliveries` table. Two endpoints expose this history:

### GET /payments/:id/webhooks

List all delivery attempts for a payment.

**Response (200 OK):**
```json
{
  "payment_id": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "deliveries": [
    {
      "id": "f47ac10b-58cc-4372-a567-0e02b2c3d479",
      "url": "https://merchant.example.com/webhook",
      "event": "payment.completed",
      "status": "delivered",
      "attempts": 2,
      "last_attempt": "2026-06-22T15:30:45",
      "created_at": "2026-06-22T15:20:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Error (404 Not Found):**
```json
{ "error": "payment not found" }
```

### POST /payments/:id/webhooks/:delivery_id/redeliver

Manually re-attempt a webhook delivery.

**Response (200 OK):**
- Delivery succeeded (empty body)

**Error (502 Bad Gateway):**
```json
{ "error": "webhook delivery failed" }
```

**Error (404 Not Found):**
```json
{ "error": "delivery not found" }
```

**Behavior:**
- Re-sends the exact same signed payload (preserves authenticity)
- Records a new attempt, incrementing the attempt counter
- Respects merchant's webhook authentication (signature recomputed from original payload)
- Sets status to `delivered` only if recipient returns 2xx
- Scoped to payment owner (merchant authentication required)

## Configuration

Configure webhook behavior via environment variables:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `WEBHOOK_SECRET` | HMAC signing secret (shared with you at gateway provisioning) | — |
| `WEBHOOK_RETRY_ATTEMPTS` | Inline delivery retry count | `3` |
| `WEBHOOK_RETRY_DELAY_MS` | Delay between retries | `5000` |
| `WEBHOOK_TIMEOUT_SECS` | Per-attempt timeout for outbound POST requests | `10` |
| `WEBHOOK_REDRIVE_INTERVAL_SECS` | How often background redrive worker scans for stuck deliveries | `30` |
| `WEBHOOK_REDRIVE_CONCURRENCY` | Maximum concurrent redrive attempts in flight | `4` |
| `WEBHOOK_REDRIVE_MAX_ATTEMPTS` | Total attempts (inline + redrive) before permanent failure | `8` |
| `WEBHOOK_REDRIVE_GRACE_SECS` | Grace period before a stuck delivery is touched by redrive worker | `60` |
| `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS` | Bypass SSRF guard for private IPs (dev/test only, never production) | `false` |

## Delivery Guarantee

StellarGate guarantees **at-least-once** delivery with automatic retries:

- **Initial dispatch:** When a payment settles, the webhook is dispatched synchronously with inline retries (configurable, default 3 attempts)
- **Background redrive:** If dispatch encounters an error or the process crashes mid-delivery, a background worker periodically scans for stuck deliveries and redrives them
- **Idempotency:** Use the `payment_id` as a deduplication key on your end. If you receive the same `payment_id` twice, it's a retry — process it idempotently
- **Timestamps for ordering:** Use `created_at` (initial creation time) or `updated_at` (last change time) from payment status to order events, not webhook delivery times

## SSRF Protection

All webhook URLs are validated for SSRF attacks:

- Hostname is resolved and checked against loopback (`127.0.0.0/8`), link-local (`169.254.0.0/16`), private (`10.0.0.0/8`, `172.16.0.0/12`, `192.168.0.0/16`), and reserved ranges
- The same check runs on every redelivery against the exact resolved address (not a fresh DNS lookup), preventing DNS-rebinding attacks
- Production deployments enforce HTTPS; testnet/development allows HTTP
- Set `WEBHOOK_ALLOW_PRIVATE_TARGETS=true` only for local development

## Integration Checklist

- [ ] Store `WEBHOOK_SECRET` securely in environment (never commit)
- [ ] Implement signature verification with timestamp freshness check
- [ ] Use constant-time comparison for signature checking
- [ ] Read event type from JSON body, not from `X-StellarGate-Event` header
- [ ] Make webhook handler idempotent (deduplicate by `payment_id`)
- [ ] Return HTTP 2xx for success; any other status triggers retries
- [ ] Keep handler fast; long-running tasks should be queued asynchronously
- [ ] Log all webhook events for audit trail
- [ ] Monitor redelivery dashboard for failed deliveries
- [ ] Set up alerts for delivery failures
- [ ] Test signature verification with provided examples before going live

## Integration Examples

### Complete Workflow

**Step 1: Create a payment with webhook**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/payments \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "amount": "100.0",
    "asset": "XLM",
    "merchant_id": "my-shop",
    "webhook_url": "https://yourapp.com/webhooks/stellar"
  }'
```

**Step 2: User sends payment via Stellar wallet**

Sends exactly 100 XLM to the destination address with memo included.

**Step 3: StellarGate detects and verifies transaction**

Detects on-chain transaction within ~1-10 seconds (depends on network).

**Step 4: Webhook delivered to your endpoint**

```
POST https://yourapp.com/webhooks/stellar
Content-Type: application/json
X-StellarGate-Timestamp: 1719072645
X-StellarGate-Signature: 3f5e...
X-StellarGate-Event: payment.completed

{
  "event": "payment.completed",
  "payment_id": "550e8400-...",
  "merchant_id": "my-shop",
  "tx_hash": "abc123def456...",
  "amount": "100.00",
  "paid_amount": "100.00",
  "asset": "XLM",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

**Step 5: Check delivery status (optional)**

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/payments/550e8400-.../webhooks
```

Response shows all attempts and their status (delivered/failed/pending).

**Step 6: If delivery failed, manually redeliver**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/payments/550e8400-.../webhooks/[delivery-id]/redeliver
```

### Handling Overpayment

User sends 120 XLM instead of 100 XLM:

```json
{
  "event": "payment.overpaid",
  "payment_id": "550e8400-...",
  "merchant_id": "my-shop",
  "tx_hash": "abc123def456...",
  "amount": "100.00",
  "paid_amount": "120.00",
  "asset": "XLM",
  "status": "completed",
  "delta": "20.00"
}
```

Your app should track the `delta` and issue a refund to the sender for the excess.

### Handling Underpayment (Top-up)

User sends 70 XLM (shortfall of 30 XLM):

```json
{
  "event": "payment.underpaid",
  "payment_id": "550e8400-...",
  "merchant_id": "my-shop",
  "tx_hash": "abc123def456...",
  "amount": "100.00",
  "paid_amount": "70.00",
  "asset": "XLM",
  "status": "underpaid",
  "delta": "30.00"
}
```

The payment intent stays open and watchable. If user sends the remaining 30 XLM (or more) to the same address and memo, you'll receive:

```json
{
  "event": "payment.completed",
  "payment_id": "550e8400-...",
  "merchant_id": "my-shop",
  "tx_hash": "def456abc123...",  // Different on-chain transaction
  "amount": "100.00",
  "paid_amount": "100.00",  // Cumulative total
  "asset": "XLM",
  "status": "completed"
}
```

### Handling Expiry

No payment arrives before TTL (default 1 hour):

```json
{
  "event": "payment.expired",
  "payment_id": "550e8400-...",
  "merchant_id": "my-shop",
  "tx_hash": null,
  "amount": "100.00",
  "paid_amount": null,
  "asset": "XLM",
  "status": "expired"
}
```

Payment intent is no longer watched. The user must create a new payment intent if they want to retry.
