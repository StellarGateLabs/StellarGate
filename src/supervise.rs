// ── Panic-risk audit (#432) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// All `.unwrap()` / `.expect()` in this file are confined to the `#[cfg(test)]`
// module below. Production code in this module does not call either.
//
// Test-only usages and why they are safe there:
//
// * `tokio::time::timeout(…).await.expect("…")` — test assertion: the timeout
//   resolving to `Err` is the test *failing*, not a recoverable error.
// * `handle.await.expect("supervisor task panicked")` — same: a JoinError here
//   means the test itself is broken.
// * `exits.lock().unwrap().pop()` — the Mutex is never poisoned inside a test;
//   a poison would surface as a panic in the test infrastructure, not in
//   production code.
// * `.unwrap()` on `tokio::time::timeout` results used as assertions — as above.
//
// None of these patterns appear outside `#[cfg(test)]`, so they carry zero
// production panic risk.
