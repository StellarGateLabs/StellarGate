//! Stellar Horizon integration: detecting and verifying on-chain payments.
//!
//! A background poller periodically asks Horizon for the most recent payments
//! into the gateway account, matches them against pending payment intents by
//! transaction memo, verifies the asset and amount, and transitions the intent
//! to a terminal or watchable state, firing a webhook in each case.
//!
//! ## Payment resolution policy
//!
//! | Scenario | DB status | Webhook event | Notes |
//! |---|---|---|---|
//! | Paid exactly the requested amount | `completed` | `payment.completed` | — |
//! | Paid **more** than requested | `completed` | `payment.overpaid` | `delta` = excess; merchant should refund |
//! | Paid **less** than requested | `underpaid` | `payment.underpaid` | `delta` = shortfall; intent stays watchable |
//! | Top-up brings total to exactly expected | `completed` | `payment.completed` | — |
//! | Top-up brings total above expected | `completed` | `payment.overpaid` | `delta` = cumulative excess |
//!
//! Once an intent reaches `completed`, it is removed from the watchlist.
//! Any subsequent on-chain payment to the same address and memo is silently
//! ignored — it will not trigger an additional webhook.
//!
//! Multiple follow-up (top-up) payments are supported per underpaid intent.
//! Every processed transaction is recorded in the `processed_transactions`
//! join table, and the cumulative received amount is the SUM over that set, so
//! re-seeing a transaction (on a later poll cycle, over the stream, or from a
//! concurrent reconciler) never double-counts and the ledger is independent of
//! the order records arrive in. The payment row's `tx_hash` still records the
//! most recent processed transaction for display.
//!
//! ## Finality
//!
//! A payment only settles an intent when its joined transaction reports
//! `successful: true`. Matching on type/destination/memo/asset/amount is not
//! sufficient for money movement — a failed, replaced, or reorg-orphaned
//! transaction can carry all the right fields yet move no funds. We therefore
//! require the `successful` flag explicitly (records are always fetched with
//! `join=transactions`, so it is present) rather than relying on the implicit
//! and undocumented behaviour that Horizon's payments-for-account endpoint
//! tends to surface only successful operations.
//!
//! The matching logic in [`verify`] is pure and unit-tested; the networked
//! functions wrap it with I/O.
